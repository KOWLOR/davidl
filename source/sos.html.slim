## Donnez moi 48 heures, je vous livrerais un meilleur site internet.

You have a website. It's not terribly broken. It works...technically. It's...fine. It's just a little old. You're worried because it's not bringing in customers, leads, or sales like it used to. You can tell it's no longer up to date and you are falling behind your competitors. People are complaining to you that the site is slow and takes too long to load, and you can see the costs of that in your sales.

This is not your expertise. You know you need to make a change, but you can't put your finger on what. Your failing website also means you don't have the money for a pricey redesign or to engage a technical expert in weeks of work. You need someone to give it an emergency rescue. Fast.

This is where we come in.

In less than 48 hours we can diagnose the problems with your site and address them. Sound too good to be true? It's not. Rather than starting from scratch with a new website, we make dozens of small, simple fixes to your existing website. While no one change is major, all of those changes combined make a big impact on your users and subsequently your sales. Your website gets a performance makeover and a design facelift, and it's all over in two days. Think of us like a Navy SEAL Team for your business. (Yes, we do have helicopters, but they're remote-control.)

Because we get this done so quickly, we can keep our prices low on these projects. A website rescue will cost you less than two thousand dollars. We also want you to get the maximum return for each dollar you invest in your website. If your website's bounce rate hasn't been reduced 30 days after our redesign, we'll revise it until it does.
